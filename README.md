Pages:
•	Landing page - shows a list of movies on a selected date at one of the cinemas. The software finds the cinema at the same district as the client and picks that as default. User can then click on one of the showings of the movies so see more info about them.
•	Movie page - shows data about a specific movie showing, has a function to book seats for the showing for a given email. Seats are dynamic based on the size of the theater hall and seats that are already booked cannot be booked again (they're shown in red), user selects from green seats and the selected ones turn blue.
•	Bookings page - user can see the bookings they have for a provided email. The bookings seats can be edited or the booking can be deleted.
•	Admin dashboard - admin can view movie showings for a selected cinema and a given timeframe between two dates. Each viewing's time can be edited and the viewing can be deleted.
•	About page - static page where user can read about us and the project
